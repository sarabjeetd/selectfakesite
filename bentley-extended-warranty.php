			<h2 id="why-is-a-bentley-warranty-policy-a-must" class="mb-2 mt-3">Why is a Bentley Warranty Policy a Must?</h2>

		

			<p class="mb-2">As a Bentley owner, you know how important it is to drive the best. If your car is important to you, why would you not do everything you could to protect it? You never know what could happen on the open road. Make sure you’re covered with a Bentley extended warranty. You have invested in a high-quality car that you expect to take care of you in any situation. Whether taking a trip across town or the country, you want your Bentley to be a reliable vehicle, but it cannot take care of you if you do not take care of your vehicle. A Bentley Warranty will cover normal wear and tear as well as any unordinary issues that come with extended travel. Take care of your vehicle with a Bentley Warranty.</p> 



			<p class="mb-2">A Bentley warranty will ensure that you will not be responsible for covering the full bill for extensive repairs. Our warranty packages make sure that big surprise repairs are covered. Without out warranty, some repairs can cost thousands of dollars and if you are not prepared to cover it yourself, you may be without your Bentley until you can cover it. Don’t let any major issues keep you from driving your Bentley. </p>



			<p class="mb-2">An extended Bentley warranty will make a vehicle of any age feel like a new car. With a warranty, you can afford regular service that will keep your car feeling like new. A warranty will ensure that you can get the most out of your Bentley for the entire time you own or lease your vehicle.</p>

			

			<h2 id="what-does-a-bentley-warranty-cover" class="mb-2 mt-3">What does a Bentley Warranty Cover?</h2>

			

			<p class="mb-2">Our Bentley Extended warranty comes in three different options of coverage. Depending on the level of coverage you choose, your warranty will cover everything from your engine to your suspension. All packages cover roadside assistance and give coverage on the basic systems in your car.</p> 

			<p class="mb-2">The more coverage you choose to take, the more of your Bentley is protected. Our second tier of coverage includes repairs to your steering system, while the Platinum tier adds features such as your AC and heat, fuel system, and suspension. </p> 

			<p class="mb-2">If you want to cover your entire car in floor-to-ceiling protection, your best option is the Platinum package. While the other two tiers of coverage protect most of your vehicle, you shouldn't leave anything to chance on the road.</p> 

			<h2 id="is-a-bentley-extended-warranty-policy-worth-it" class="mb-2 mt-3">Is a Bentley Extended Warranty Policy worth it?</h2>

			

			<p class="mb-2">The biggest decision when judging whether to get an extended warranty on your Bentley is the price. You may be asking yourself if it is necessary to spend the extra money on a warranty in addition to your regular car payments. Is the coverage required, or can you still sneak by and hope for the best?</p> 

			<p class="mb-2">On average, a major repair on your Bentley can cost upwards of ten thousand dollars. If something happens to your vehicle when you do not have an extended warranty you are stuck with the cost of repair. Servicing your Bentley regularly can also add up over time. </p> 

			<p class="mb-2">A Bentley extended warranty can cover the costs of wear and tear and major repairs. With a warranty, you won’t have to shell out thousands of dollars if your car needs a repair. In the long run, an extended warranty will save you money on all types of services for your Bentley. In addition to saving you money on repairs, an extended warranty will keep your Bentley in better shape for a longer time.</p> 

			<p class="mb-2">If you ever decide to sell your Bentley, a warranty-covered car will sell for more. The Bentley warranty cost is minimal when considering the possible money you will have to pay without one. You cannot afford not to cover your vehicle with the blanket of protection that comes with an extended warranty.</p>



			<h3 id="extended-warranty-for-new-bentleys" class="mb-2 mt-3">Extended Warranty for New Bentleys</h3>

			<p class="mb-2">An extended warranty is an absolute must for your new car. Protect your large investment with an extended warranty that will cover any major repairs. You just spent a large amount of money on a high-end new Bentley. Don’t get stuck paying for costly repairs on your new Bentley. Check out our Bentley extended warranties for your new car.</p>

			<h3 id="extended-warranty-for-pre-owned-bentleys" class="mb-2 mt-3">Extended Warranty for Pre-owned Bentleys</h3>

			<p class="mb-2">Although you may not think it is necessary, a Bentley extended warranty is just as crucial for a pre-owned Bentley as it is for a new Bentley. If you acquire your Bentley after a different owner, your vehicle may be a slightly higher risk for a major repair. A Bentley extended warranty can help you cover significant costs on older cars. Your warranty will help you retain the value of your pre-owned Bentley so that you can still sell your car when you are finished with it.</p>
