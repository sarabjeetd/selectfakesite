            <p class="mb-2 text-left">When you think about the vehicles that provide confidence, high working performance, and at the same time, quality, and unique design - German car brands, probably going to be the first. Concerns like Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and Audi have created a reputation of timeless pieces.  Their frequently updated models not only add functionality but also help them stay on the front line of technologies and craftsmanship. 

			</p>

			<p class="mb-2">

			However, every Audi owner has to be aware that these luxury privileges will come at a high cost as soon as the first breakdowns appear. But what about the factory warranty? - you will ask. Yes, as a highly reliable brand, Audi provides a four-year warranty, but in fact, this is the main trap of Audi’s excellence. 

			</p>

			<p class="mb-2">

			The warranty is not only a tribute to the legislation that obliges manufacturers to be responsible for the quality of their products but also a serious argument that can lure a client. That is why sometimes brands promise, at first glance, conditions that are not very favorable for themselves. 

			</p>

			<p class="mb-2">		

			The reality is that the repairs will often be necessary after the Audi standard warranty expires. So, the best solution which you can implement with Select Auto Protect is to buy Audi extended warranty. With our exclusive vehicle protection services, you can be sure that you won’t have to pay thousands of dollars tomorrow and be in peace of mind. 

			</p>

			<p class="mb-2">

			In any case, in this article, you will find out about the cost of the Audi extended warranty and why you need it to sleep calmly.

			<h2 id="audi_link1" class="mb-2 mt-3">What is an extended car warranty?</h2>  

			

			<p class="mb-2">An extended warranty is simply an additional warranty that will be working for your vehicle even when your original Audi cover will end up. As the Audi manufacturer's warranty is a 4-year plan or 50,000 miles mileage, you will have to pay every repair cost from your pocket as soon as it ends. Thus, you need to know that even buying an extended warranty, you have to clearly understand what is already included in it and what is not, while your extended warranty may be quite different from the manufacturer's warranty. Also, take into account Audi coverage is not the same as coverage of other brands.</p> 



			<p class="mb-2">The best you can do to choose the correct warranty is to educate yourself more about the possible pain points of your Audi model. Thereby, another positive factor in favor of an extended warranty is that it can be bought for the pre-owned vehicle and the new car. And at this point, if you have a used car, the coverage becomes totally essential, as it is much more likely to break due to age. On the other hand, when you are purchasing a new vehicle, and you are planning to use it for more than four years (for the majority of people, it’s going to be their case), a warranty will be a strong argument when you decide to sell the car. As a rule, used cars with an extended warranty are more valued on the market and can be sold at a higher price.</p>

			

			<h2 id="audi_link2" class="mb-2 mt-3">Audi standard warranty and what is inside it</h2>

			

			<p class="mb-2">To better understand why you need an Audi extended warranty, you have to be aware of all the pros and cons of the domain warranty. Also, before we start, don’t forget that all of the factors that will be listed are valid only for the completely new cars, which becomes one more reason to acquire the wide warranty.</p> 

			<p class="mb-2">So, in Audi original warranty you can find:</p> 

			<ul class="ml-4">

			<li class="ml-4">

			50,000 miles or 4-years warranty duration

			</li> 

			<li class="ml-4">

			24- hours roadside assistance during the 4 years

			</li>

			<li class="ml-4">	

			Corrosion problem solving is free during the first year of utilization

			</li>

			<li class="ml-4">	

			Two first maintenance visits are also free during 1 year or 10,000 miles

			</li>

			<li class="ml-4">	

			Audi covers almost all the mechanical and electrical breakdowns 

			</li>

			<li class="ml-4">

			If you decide to sell a car before the original warranty expires, it can be automatically transferred to the new owner

			</li>

			</ul>

			<p class="mb-2">As you can see, the warranty is really a thing, and on these terms, you may ask yourself a question like: "If the manufacturer is so confident in their products, why do I need a warranty?". And the answer is simple. The day your original warranty is finished, you will find yourself unprotected, and, of course, all the major collapses begin after those four years of usage.</p>

			

			<h2 id="audi_link3" class="mb-2 mt-3">Common Audi repairs</h2> 

			<p class="mb-2">Unfortunately, even the most quality cars like Audi inevitably break due to the aging of the parts. Moreover, the more luxury and security the car is, the more expensive it costs to fix the malfunction. That is why we want to present some of the most common issues and provide you with a vision of how much you are likely to spend annually on repairs.</p> 

			<ol>

			<li>

			Ignition Coil - the average price is between $200 - $400

			</li>

			<li>

			Catalytic Converter - starts from $150 and up to $750

			</li>

			<li>	

			Transmission failure - between $1,800 - $3,400

			</li>

			<li>	

			Exhaust Gas Recirculation - from $300 - $800

			</li>

			<li>

			Water pump failure - between $2000 and $3000

			</li>

			<li>	

			Collision repairs - can be very different, but generally from $500 to $2,500+

			</li>

			</ol>

			<p class="mb-2">Also, according to many resources, the average annual repair cost is about $990.</p> 



			<p class="mb-2">Evidently, considering these prices, many uncovered users are reasonable when they are told that sometimes it is cheaper to buy a new car than fixing the old one.</p>

			This way, we provide full coverage of all of your needs. Nevertheless, the gold and silver plans can be less wide, but still, they cover all major expenses that may arise. Also, it shouldn’t be forgotten that not all tariff plans offered in the Audi dealership will be as beneficial as third-party providers, like ours. Usually, they offer plans that are much more expensive and very limited.

			<p class="mb-2">

			<h2 id="audi_link6" class="mb-2 mt-3">Differences between Audi warranty and SAP extended warranty</h2>

			<p class="mb-2">						

			As any luxury brand, Audi’s cars are so greatly crafted, that it becomes quite difficult to repeat. This is one of the main reasons why their vehicle details are so pricey. Also, Audi is assisting only for the new cars and hardly limits their presence in the fate of your vehicle after the four years of original warranty is ended. 

			</p>

			<p class="mb-2">

			So, what are the pros of Select Auto Protect compared to the Audi warranty? First of all, the age of your car doesn’t play a role at all, while it only matters the good working condition of it when you are obtaining a warranty. Secondly, we cover all of the Audi models, and everything you need to supply is your current reading on the odometer and vehicle VIN. Thirdly, there is absolutely no paperwork, and you don't have first to pay and then reimburse the money. You just come to the repair facility and show your warranty. We are paying directly by credit card. 

			</p>

			

			<h2 class="mb-2 mt-3">Final thoughts</h2>

			<p class="mb-2">
