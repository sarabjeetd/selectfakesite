            <p class="mb-2 text-left">A Kia is a way to go when you want a high-quality and reliable vehicle that will last years. Whether your Kia is a high-performance luxury model or a more affordable vehicle, it is vital to protect your investment for the long term. A Kia extended warranty will keep your car on the road so that you can get the most out of your purchase.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2 text-left">Whether you buy a brand-new Kia, lease a lightly used Kia, or pick up a pre-owned Kia, an extended warranty will protect your vehicle long after the factory warranty is up. An extended warranty policy on your Kia is a must if you want to retain the value that your Kia holds. Even if you do not plan to sell your Kia, keep it at its best with an extended auto warranty.</p>

			

			<h2 id="audi_link1" class="mb-2 mt-3">Why is a Kia Warranty Policy a Must?</h2>  

			

			<p class="mb-2">You never know what could happen on the open road. If your car is essential to you, why would you not do everything you could to protect it? Make sure you're covered with a Kia extended warranty. An average warranty for a Kia does not cover everything you need to ensure that your vehicle will be protected in every situation. Add additional coverage so that you have peace of mind that your car will always be safe.</p> 



			<p class="mb-2">You never know when an accident can happen. With a Kia extended warranty, you can be sure that your car is covered no matter what happens. Unplanned repairs can cost thousands of dollars. If you do not have warranty coverage, you could be responsible for expensive repairs when your Kia is damaged. An extended warranty makes sure you are covered even when your factory warranty expires.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">An extended Kia warranty will make a vehicle of any age feel like a new car. You can afford regular service that will keep your car as good as gold with a warranty. A warranty will ensure that you can get the most out of your Kia for the entire time that you own or lease your vehicle.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">An extended warranty for your Kia will ensure that you are covered for all of the expenses with your car. Whether you need to cover regular planned maintenance or unplanned emergency repairs, a Kia extended warranty has you covered. Even in the worst-case scenario, an extended auto warranty will give you peace of mind that you will not be stuck by expensive repairs and parts replacement. Take care of your Kia the same way that it takes care of you with an extended car warranty.</p>

			

			

			<h2 id="audi_link2" class="mb-2 mt-3">What does a Kia Warranty Cover?</h2>

			

			<p class="mb-2">Our Kia Extended warranty comes in three different options of coverage. Depending on the level of coverage you prefer, your warranty will cover everything from your engine to your suspension. All packages include roadside assistance and coverage on the primary systems in your car. The more coverage you choose to take, the more of your Kia is protected. Our second tier of coverage includes repairs to your steering system, while the Platinum tier adds features such as your AC and heat, fuel system, and suspension.</p> 

			

			<p class="mb-2">If you are looking to cover your entire car in floor-to-ceiling protection, your best option is the Platinum package. While the other two tiers of coverage protect most of your vehicle, you shouldn't leave anything to chance on the road.</p>

			

			<h2 id="audi_link3" class="mb-2 mt-3">Extended Warranty for New Kias</h2>

			

			<p class="mb-2">An extended warranty is an absolute must for your new car. Technological advances make every new model year of Kia's more expensive to repair. From onboard computers to advanced computers, new Kia repairs can be costly. You may think that a new car does not need extended coverage. However, an extended warranty can cover more than a standard factory warranty. Protect your significant investment with an extended warranty that will cover any major repairs. You just spent a large amount of money on a high-end new Kia. Don't get stuck paying for costly repairs on your new Kia. Check out our Kia extended warranties for your new car.</p>

			

			<h2 id="audi_link3" class="mb-2 mt-3">Extended Warranty for Pre-owned Kias</h2>

			

			<p class="mb-2">Although you may not think it is necessary, a Kia extended warranty is just as important for a pre-owned Kia as it is for a new Kia. If you acquire your Kia after a different owner, your vehicle may be slightly higher risk of a major repair. A Kia extended warranty can help you cover major costs on older cars. Your warranty will help you retain the value of your pre-owned Kia so that you can still sell your car when you are finished with it. With an extended warranty, you can be sure that your pre-owned Kia will run like new. </p>

			

			<h2 id="audi_link3" class="mb-2 mt-3">Retain your Resell Value</h2>

			

			<p class="mb-2">In the current market, a well-kept used car fetches much higher prices than in the past. Make sure that you get every penny out of your Kia when it comes time to upgrade. An extended warranty policy will make sure your car is up to date on repairs and tune-ups that will keep it in tip-top shape. You must take care of your car so that it can help you take care of the next car note you take on. On average, a Kia that utilizes extra warranty coverage can be worth thousands of dollars more than a Kia that has gone unprotected from damages big and small. Don't miss out on all of the added value that an extended Kia warranty can help your vehicle retain.</p>

			

			<h2 id="audi_link3" class="mb-2 mt-3">Is a Kia Extended Warranty Policy worth it?</h2>

			

			<p class="mb-2">The price of an extended warranty policy is one of the biggest considerations you must make when deciding to cover your car in extra protection. When you consider the possible cost of repair that you would be stuck with without coverage, the value of a policy is easy to see. </p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">A major car repair can cost you thousands of dollars. If you are not financially prepared to deal with a hefty repair bill, you could risk losing your vehicle. Stay on the road with a Kia extended warranty. Both regular service and emergency repairs are covered, so you can rest assured that you are covered in case of an emergency.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">A Kia extended warranty keeps your vehicle running at its best. A well-maintained car is sure to be worth more later down the line. If you ever decide to sell your Kia, an extended car warranty can help you keep your car in good shape so you can get top dollar for your pre-owned Kia. </p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">The Kia warranty cost is minimal when you consider the possible money you will have to pay without one. You cannot afford not to cover your vehicle with the blanket of protection that comes with an extended warranty. Whether you need help covering the cost of a big repair or want to make sure you can keep up on regular maintenance, an extended warranty can help you cover the cost. Due to hefty repair costs, no one wants to be left without a vehicle. Keep your car on the road with the proper protection for your needs. Don't let yourself get blindsided by emergency repair costs. Cover your Kia in a blanket of protection with a Kia extended warranty. </p>
