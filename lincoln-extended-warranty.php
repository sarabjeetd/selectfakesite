			<p class="mb-2">With over a century under their belts, Lincoln, the luxury car brand from Ford, has successfully cemented its position in the automotive marketplace. Their vast lineup ranges from sedans to crossovers to SUVs.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">The problem is that experts don’t consider the brand very reliable.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">Even though Lincoln’s reliability seems to have considerably improved in recent years, the manufacturer isn’t exempt from having parts fail, just like any other luxury car brand.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">Add that to the automaker’s notorious reputation for having high-ticket repair costs, and you’ll understand why it’s vital for all Lincoln owners to invest in an auto warranty.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">An extended warranty from a recognized third-party provider like Select Auto Protect will give you the added advantage of total protection against expensive car repairs.</p>

			

			<h2 class="mb-2 mt-3">What Does the Lincoln Factory Warranty Cover?</h2>		

			<p class="mb-2">Lincoln’s automobiles have a host of connective services that can be costly to repair.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">The Lincoln manufacturer’s warranty ensures that every trip runs smoothly, from weekends getaways to last-minute business trips.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">A Lincoln factory warranty coverage starts on the in-service date and 0 miles and ends at the earlier of the months/miles covered.</p>



			<p class="mb-2">Here’s what Lincoln’s factory warranty covers:</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2"><strong>Bumper-to-bumper</strong> - 4 years/50,000 miles. It covers most components with a shortlist of exclusions. </p>

			

			<p class="mb-2"><strong>Safety restraint systems</strong> - 5 years/60,000 miles. It covers your car’s Airbag Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) and safety belts.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2"><strong>Powertrain</strong> - 6 years/70,000 miles. It covers your transmission, engine, front/rear-wheel drive, and related parts.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2"><strong>Rust perforation</strong> - 5 years/unlimited miles. It covers your car’s metal panels’ corrosion due to a manufacturing defect.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2"><strong>Adjustments</strong> - 12 months/12,000 miles. It covers wear and tear, such as wheel alignment, tire balancing, and brake pad/lining replacement.</p>



			<h2 class="mb-2 mt-3">What Doesn’t the Lincoln Factory Warranty Cover?</h2>

			

			<p class="mb-2">Even the most well-designed, high-quality cars experience the occasional breakdown. And that’s why you get a factory warranty cover when you buy a new Lincoln.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">However, the Lincoln factory warranty doesn’t cover everything:</p>

			<ul class="ml-4">

			<li class="ml-4">Damage caused by accidents, theft, or fire</li>

			<li class="ml-4">Tire wear or damage</li>

			<li class="ml-4">Regular maintenance</li>

			<li class="ml-4">Unauthorized modifications</li>

			<li class="ml-4">Damage from misuse of the vehicle</li>

			<li class="ml-4">Environmental damages</li>

			</ul>

			

			<p class="mb-2">Take a look at Lincoln’s online sample contracts or reach out to a local dealership to get a complete list of Lincoln factory warranty exclusions.</p>

			

			<h2 class="mb-2 mt-3">Lincoln Extended Warranty Coverage</h2>

			

			<p class="mb-2">When you’re out in the wild exploring new terrain in your 4x4, you can get to that 4-year/50,000-mile mark pretty fast. </p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">No motorist or mechanic can predict when a mechanical or electrical breakdown will happen and to what extent. That’s why many auto industry members refer to these repairs as "unexpected."</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">To avoid unnecessary costs and stay covered after the Lincoln factory warranty expires, ensure you’re protecting your investment and your car with a Lincoln extended warranty coverage.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">Lincoln Protect Extended Service Plans (ESPs) are available in 6 varieties and cover vehicles up to 125,000 miles or 8 years, whichever comes first. This is on the higher end of the industry standard.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2"><strong>PremiumCARE</strong> is comparable to a factory warranty. It covers 1,000+ parts in total. This comprehensive plan is recommended for drivers who heavily rely on their cars and want maximum protection for their automobiles.</p>



			<p class="mb-2"><strong>PremiumCARE PLUS</strong> – This is the ultimate Lincoln protection plan. It upgrades PremiumCARE coverage to offer a $0 deductible.</p> 



			<p class="mb-2"><strong>ExtraCARE</strong> – offers partial coverage on a number of systems (113 key components) at a more affordable rate. This coverage includes the transmission, A/C and heating, rear/front-wheel drive, front suspension, and high-tech components like power seat motors and cruise control.</p> 

			

			<p class="mb-2"><strong>BaseCARE</strong> – covers 84 parts. Only the steering system is fully covered. Other systems like the transmission, brakes, and electrical systems are partially covered.</p>



			<p class="mb-2"><strong>PowertrainCARE</strong> – covers the bare essentials in the transmission, engine, and drive systems (29 parts). This plan is recommended for drivers who drive a highly reliable car.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2"><strong>LeaseCARE</strong> – provides immediate rental service coverage for your car.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">All of these plans are available for cars still within their factory warranty period of 50,000 miles/4 years. They come with roadside assistance, including battery jump-starts, towing assistance of up to $100 per occurrence, lockout assistance, destination assistance, fuel deliveries, and spare tire replacements.</p> 

			

			<p class="mb-2">You can transfer any of the plans to a subsequent buyer and cancel at any time. However, you can only get these warranties from a Lincoln dealership, and all repairs have to be done at the dealership.</p>



			

			<h2 class="mb-2 mt-3">Will You Be Able to Afford to Repair Your Lincoln?</h2>

			<p class="mb-2">According to RepairPal, Lincoln vehicles have an average (3/5) reliability rating.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">The average annual cost of repairs (including both regularly scheduled maintenance and unscheduled repair service) for Lincoln vehicles is $879.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">Common Lincoln repairs and their cost include:</p>

			

			<table class="table table-bordered">

				<tr><th>Repair</th><th>Cost</th></tr>

				<tr><td>Compressor failure</td><td>$480 - $674</td></tr>

				<tr><td>Water pump replacement</td><td>$394 - $563</td></tr>

				<tr><td>Power steering pump</td><td>$407 - $480</td></tr>

				<tr><td>Alternator replacement</td><td>$382 - $405</td></tr>

				<tr><td>Shock replacement</td><td>$1,045 - $1,093</td></tr>

				<tr><td>Head gasket replacement</td><td>$2,631 - $3,866</td></tr>

			<p class="mb-2">Select Auto Protect works to protect Lincoln cars and their owners from the exorbitant cost of auto repairs. We can cover all of the above-mentioned repairs, and that one repair alone could even pay for the coverage itself!</p>



			

			<h2 class="mb-2 mt-3">Lincoln Extended Warranty Cost</h2>

			

			<p class="mb-2">The cost of a Lincoln extended warranty depends on a few factors like:</p>

			

			<ul class="ml-4">

			<li class="ml-4">Your location</li>

			<li class="ml-4">Your vehicle age, mileage, and model</li>

			<li class="ml-4">The plan you choose the time you purchase the plan</li>

			<li class="ml-4">Your preferred deductible</li>

			</ul>



			<p class="mb-2">Motorists can select deductibles of $0, $50, $100, or $200, which will be waived upon visiting your selling dealership for repairs.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">That said, the average cost of an extended warranty from Lincoln is $1,500.</p>



			<h2 class="mb-2 mt-3">Lincoln New Car Warranty</h2>

			<p class="mb-2">Even cars as respected and acclaimed as Lincoln will break down at some point, and no one will know when or where. And once the manufacturer’s warranty expires, the cost is all on you.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">When you get a warranty for your new car, you get much-needed peace of mind. This way, you can spend more time driving your car instead of worrying about it.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">All covered repairs are done by factory-trained technicians who use original Lincoln parts.</p>

			

			<h2 class="mb-2 mt-3">Lincoln Used Car Warranty</h2>

			<p class="mb-2">You might not need a Lincoln extended warranty if you’re currently covered under a factory warranty. But it’s worth considering investing in extended coverage as your car nears the end of its factory warranty coverage.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">Once the manufacturer’s warranty expires on your Lincoln, you could be hit with costly and inconvenient repair bills.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">Lincoln used car warranty requires a vehicle inspection because used plans are bought outside the factory Warranty.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">Purchasing a certified pre-owned (CPO) car can save you some cash. Lincoln’s CPO warranty typically extends most factory warranty coverage to 100,000 miles/6 years. Motorists also can go for PremiumCARE coverage that lasts up to 125,000 miles/8 years.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">Extended warranty coverage terms for used Lincoln cars commence on the purchase date of the contract. If you want to keep cruising in your Lincoln luxury car past 125,000 miles, it could make economic sense to get a basic third-party service contract to cover the essentials.</p>

			

			<h2 class="mb-2 mt-3">Should You Purchase an Extended Warranty from Lincoln or a Third-Party Provider?</h2>

			

			<p class="mb-2">When you purchase an extended warranty from Lincoln, you get extensive coverage backed by the same company that made your vehicle.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">Your car is serviced with genuine parts, but repairs can only be done at authorized Lincoln or Ford facilities. This might be a deal-breaker if you have a mechanic you like at a private repair shop. Also, coverage periods are shorter than third-party warranties.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">Purchasing a Lincoln from a dealer does not mean your only extended warranty option is via the manufacturer. Third-party warranty plans can cover most (if not all) of what dealership plans cover, and they come with added flexibility. You can buy whenever the timing is right for you, and most allow motorists to visit any certified repair shop of their choice.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">Getting stuck beside the road miles from home isn’t fun. Most extended warranties from third-party providers include bonuses like 24-hour roadside assistance and trip interruption benefits. </p>



			<h2 class="mb-2 mt-3">Risk-Free Coverage with Select Auto Protect</h2>

			

			<p class="mb-2">Select Auto Protect will cover your Lincoln car for less, protecting you against costly repairs from bumper to bumper.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">The plan even pays for itself — Select Auto Protect warranty coverage gives you 24/7 roadside assistance, award-winning customer service, exclusive access to discounts, your choice of a licensed mechanic, and a 100 percent online claims process.</p>
