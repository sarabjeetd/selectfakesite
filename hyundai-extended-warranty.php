            <p class="mb-2 text-left">Established in 1967, Hyundai is a South Korean auto-manufacturer that has since grown to become one of the country's top five automobile manufacturers. It is also the second-largest manufacturer of vehicles in an alliance with Kia Motors and the third-largest automaker in Asia. Hyundai, best known for reliability and cost-effectiveness, offers automobile models in various segments ranging from luxury to performance, as well as hybrid vehicles.</p>

			

			<h2 class="mb-2 mt-3">Why is a Warranty Important?</h2>

			

			<p class="mb-2">So why do you need a Hyundai warranty? It is simple; it gives you peace of mind and ensures that your prized possession is secure and protected. In addition, the warranty assures that if something goes wrong, the company will sort it out for you, even for a used car.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">With the investment of your hard-earned cash on the purchase of the product, the least you can expect from the manufacturer is assurance that everything is mint.</p> 

			<h2 id="audi_link1" class="mb-2 mt-3">Two Types of Warranty</h2>  

			

			<p class="mb-2">Warranties are usually divided into two categories: limited lifetime warranty and limited warranty. A limited lifetime warranty is provided by the manufacturer that assures the customer that the product will be covered by the manufacturer as long as you possess it. However, this does not necessarily mean that you cannot seek assistance for repairs during this period. </p> 



			<p class="mb-2">For example, if you have a product with a limited lifetime warranty, you can seek assistance from the store where you originally bought it from or any other service center. The other type of warranty is called a limited warranty which lasts for a certain amount of time, ranging between 40 days to five years.</p>

			

			<h2 id="audi_link2" class="mb-2 mt-3">Hyundaiâ€™s Reliability</h2>

			

			<p class="mb-2">Hyundai cars are well-known in the USA for their high quality and long-lasting reliability. As a driver, you expect your vehicle to be there when you need it to. If the car conks out on your way to work, you want to know you can count on getting there without severe damage to yourself or others, all the while keeping traffic delays and emergency road services costs at a minimum. It's no surprise that Korean auto giant Hyundai Motor Company has now established itself as one of the most trusted and safest brands in today's fast-paced world of automobiles.</p> 

			

			<h2 id="audi_link3" class="mb-2 mt-3">Hyundai New Limited Warranty</h2> 

			<p class="mb-2">Hyundai automobiles have a five-year or 60,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty, whichever comes first. The Hyundai warranty covers manufacturing flaws in materials and workmanship, a natural problem faced by all manufacturers. This warranty covers components on the outside, interior, electronic, and chassis. Paint is one of the few exceptions, as it is protected for three years or 36,000 miles.</p> 

			<h2 id="audi_link3" class="mb-2 mt-3">Extra Benefits</h2>

			<p class="mb-2">Free servicing and reimbursements are included in the Hyundai extended warranty. You can also enjoy the following benefits with a Hyundai Protection Plan Vehicle Service Contract:</p>

			<ul class="ml-4">

					<li class="ml-4">Coverage that can be transferred</li> 

					<li class="ml-4">Genuine Hyundai parts</li>

					<li class="ml-4">Reimbursement for a rental automobile</li> 

					<li class="ml-4">Roadside support is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</li> 

					<li class="ml-4">Towing services to a Hyundai dealership or authorized facility are available.</li> 

					<li class="ml-4">Coverage for trip cancellations</li>

				</ul>



			<h3 id="audi_link3" class="mb-2 mt-3">Hyundai Extended Warranty Cost</h3>

			<p class="mb-2">The cost of your insurance depends on your vehicle's model, year, and previous coverage. Vehicle servicing contracts will cost between $350 and $700 each year, according to research. To find out Hyundai extended warranty price, <b>contact us</b> to get a quote. </p>

			<p class="mb-2">Extended warranties from dealerships, on the other hand, are frequently more expensive. Hyundai offers two deductible options for their vehicle repair contracts: $0 and $100. When you choose a lower deductible, your premiums will almost always be higher. When you combine the warranty cost with the cost of your motor loan, Hyundai also offers a monthly payment option. However, we advise you to avoid doing so because you will end up paying more in interest. </p>

			

			<h2 id="audi_link3" class="mb-2 mt-3">What is Not Covered by a Hyundai Extended Warranty?</h2>

			<p class="mb-2">There are specified exclusions that apply to any extended car warranty. Repairs are not covered under the Hyundai extended warranty and further include:</p>

				<li class="ml-4">Items such as brake pads and shoes should be worn</li>

				<li class="ml-4">Hyundai's factory warranty covers mechanical failures</li>

				<li class="ml-4">Accidents, collisions, vandalism, or weather-related damage-causing mechanical breakdowns.</li>

			</ul>



			<h2 id="audi_link3" class="mb-2 mt-3">Hyundai U.S. Warranty</h2>

			<ul class="ml-4">

				<li class="ml-4">Anti-perforation warranty of 7 years/unlimited miles</li>

				<li class="ml-4">24-hour roadside assistance for five years/unlimited miles</li>

				<li class="ml-4">Except for the hybrid/electric battery guarantee, all of these warranties are transferable to a private party.</li>

			</ul>

			<h2 id="audi_link3" class="mb-2 mt-3">Hyundai Certified Pre-owned Warranty</h2>

			<p class="mb-2">You get the remainder of the five-year/60,000-mile new vehicle limited warranty with your certified pre-owned (CPO) Hyundai, as well as:</p>

				<li class="ml-4">Your Hyundai comes with a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty that starts when it is put into service.</li>

			</ul>

			<h2 id="audi_link3" class="mb-2 mt-3">Benefits of Extended Warranty</h2>

			

			<ul class="ml-4">

				<li class="ml-4"><strong>PEACE OF MIND</strong></li>

			</ul>	

			<p class="mb-2">The most valuable benefit of an extended warranty is peace of mind. If you are not willing to face the risk of not having a warranty, it is preferable to buy one. We don't like paying for extended warranties like we don't like paying for vehicle insurance, but we're glad we have it when we need it.</p>

			

			<ul class="ml-4">

				<li class="ml-4"><strong>REPAIRS</strong></li>

			</ul>	

			<p class="mb-2">If you have an extended warranty, you can file a claim for repairs. You are protected as long as the reason fits within the warranty's restrictions. Just be sure you know what's covered and what isn't when you buy the extended coverage.</p>

			

			<ul class="ml-4">

				<li class="ml-4"><strong>PROTECTION AGAINST FOOD SPOILAGE</strong></li>

			</ul>	

			<p class="mb-2">Those who acquire refrigerator coverage may be covered for food spoiling losses. This is excellent insurance for food sector professionals, such as restaurant operators.</p>

			

			<ul class="ml-4">

				<li class="ml-4"><strong>REPLACEMENT</strong></li>

			</ul>	

			<p class="mb-2">You are entitled to a complete replacement if your appliance stops operating completely, and the reason for the failure is covered.</p>

			

			<ul class="ml-4">

				<li class="ml-4"><strong>SAVINGS IN THE LONG RUN</strong></li>

			</ul>	

			<p class="mb-2">You are protecting yourself against financial loss when you purchase an extended warranty. When you buy an extended warranty, you hope that the item will last the entire time you have it. Therefore, you are protected if something goes wrong. This will save you money in the long run.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">All those assets we ensure at Select Auto Protect. Just choose the coverage plan to suit your needs. </p>
