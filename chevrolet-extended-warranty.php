By buying a Chevrolet, you can be sure that you will find something that will fully meet your expectations. Not for nothing, it is the Chevrolet that is the favorite car of many generations of Americans. </p>

			<p class="mb-2">The other principal feature of the vehicle is safety. It becomes a key point while producing, as Chevrolet creators believe, that there is nothing more crucial than it. But, in conditions where your car takes care of you, who will take care of your car? We do not question your desire to protect your vehicle and yourself from damage and waste. That is the place where the Chevy extended warranty appears. Yes, we do remember that you still have a manufacturer's warranty. The drought is what you are going to do when it expires? While, as you know, it lasts only for three years or 36,000 miles, depending on which of them will end up first. </p>

			<p class="mb-2">The solution is an extended warranty coverage provided by an independent third-party company, like Select Auto Protect. This kind of warranty usually gives you an aссess to the greatest coverage of costs in the event of breakdowns and can be much cheaper than GM’s original warranty. </p>

			<h2 id="what-is-an-extended-chevy-warranty" class="mb-2 mt-3">What is an extended Chevy warranty?</h2>		

			<p class="mb-2">In a nutshell, an extended warranty is car protection, which people tend to buy in case that their original new car warranty has come to an end. As we have already mentioned, Chevrolet's original warranty covers three years or 36,000 miles, and that means that after the finishing of it, all of your expenses will be paid from your pocket. Thus, whether to purchase a warranty or not isn’t a question. The question is how to choose it, and why do you have to buy it from a third-party dealer and not from a Chevrolet salon? </p>

			<p class="mb-2">It is essential to understand that Chevrolet extended warranty is quite limited in what it offers and doesn’t cover all of the aspects, as the completely new car warranty, despite the fact the same company provided it. Also, even when you have decided to take a third-party warranty, you should be aware of many aspects that it proposes to meet your needs. After all, many customers tend to purchase a warranty without even reading it, receiving huge checks after something breaks. Besides, among the other attitudes of a Chevy extended warranty coverage, you can transfer it anytime to the new vehicle owner if you would like to sell it. </p>



			<h2 id="chevrolet-new-car-warranty-and-how-does-it-work" class="mb-2 mt-3">Chevrolet new car warranty and how does it work? </h2>

			<p class="mb-2">Okay, now, let’s try to understand how the new Chevrolet factory warranty functions to consider every aspect. It’s essential to know what you have a right to use and how it will affect your outlay, especially in terms of prices. </p>

			<p class="mb-2">Accordingly, as a new Chevrolet owner, you have access to:</p>

			<ul class="ml-4">

				<li  class="ml-4">Repairs for the first 3-4 years or 36,000 miles bumper-to-bumper warranty, whatever comes first.</li>

				<li  class="ml-4">Powertrain coverage for material and workmanship engine, transmission, drive system defects. </li>

				<li  class="ml-4">24-hour roadside assistance, including haulage to the nearest GM’s center, fuel delivery, flat tire changes, etc. </li>

				<li  class="ml-4">Corrosion protection together with rust-through protection. </li>

				<li  class="ml-4">Courtesy transportation. </li>

				<li  class="ml-4">First maintenance visits, which include full vehicle inspection, oil filter change, tire rotation.</li> 

				<li  class="ml-4">There is a possibility to transfer your warranty until it expires if you want to sell the vehicle.</li>

			</ul>

			<p class="mb-2">All of the above features are pretty promising, and they are, as they really cover manufacturing defects. And yet, the main argument in favor of an extended warranty is that most of the breakdowns appear after the long car utilization, which implies an already perished warranty. Moreover, the other con of the Chevrolet original coverage is that it doesn’t protect over the environmental circumstances, ill-treatment, or car modifications. So, prepare yourself that you will be paying for everything and more when your day X comes.</p>

			<h2 id="common-chevrolet-repairs" class="mb-2 mt-3">Common Chevrolet repairs</h2> 

			<p class="mb-2">If you are still not sure whether you need a Chevy vehicle extended warranty or not, we are happy to present you a list of some of the most common parts that usually tend to fail. Keep in mind that the more expensive a car is, the more high-cost it will be for you to change the part, even at the aftermarket. </p>

			<ol >

				<li >Suspension ball joint replacement - between $389 - $680</li>

				<li >Fuel pump module replacement - between $600 - $1000</li>

				<li >Manifold gasket replacement - between $400 - $700</li>

				<li >Transmission failure - between $3,500 - $5000</li>

				<li >Sliding door replacement - between $1,600 - $1,640</li>

				<li >Engine head replacement - $3,500</li>

			</ol>	

			<p class="mb-2">Evidently, Chevrolet isn’t the cheapest vehicle, so prices on most details are not so pleasant. Realizing that, Chevy extended warranty cost doesn’t seem to be something unrealistic, and on the contrary, becomes this “helping hand”. </p>

			<h2 id="why-does-select-auto-protect-have-to-be-your-choice" class="mb-2 mt-3">Why does Select Auto Protect have to be your choice? </h2>

			<p class="mb-2">We have to admit that Chevrolet vehicles are not just average cars. The customers who buy them always look for more in everything. Indeed, we find the General Motors warranty great, but they might not be interested in providing the best warranty ever for you. It may be more beneficial if you buy a new car from them. This becomes the reason to choose a third-party warranty provider. With SAP, we extend your possibilities and give you the calm and peace of mind you strive for. </p>

			<p class="mb-2">Thus, focusing on the pros of the Select Auto Protect warranty, first of all, you get a thirty-day money-back guarantee, which means you are not risking at all, and we are happy to prove to you the quality of our product. Also, you don’t need to visit the physical service, while you can easily find out an online free quote for your car, just adding some key information like year, model, and the mileage of your Chevy. Furthermore, reimbursement is never operated so fast and smoothly because there is absolutely no paperwork or a thing like you pay first, and only then, we give the money back. Your straight coverage of all expenses is only one phone call from you and the repair service. You just show the warranty, and voila!</p>

			<h2 class="mb-2 mt-3">Final thoughts</h2>
