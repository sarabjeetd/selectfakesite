			<p class="mb-2">Mercedes Benz is a popular choice for people looking for a luxurious vehicle. It is known as one of the most renowned vehicle manufacturers in the automotive industry. Mercedes-Benz produces a wide range of vehicles, ranging from high-end SUVs to smaller sports cars.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">Mercedes Benz vehicles are made with the best quality materials; therefore, they will cost a little more than the average car. Repair prices are often greater as well, so having a Mercedes Benz auto warranty might help you save money throughout your possession.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">After your home, the most expensive item most Americans own is their car. However, not every car's maintenance costs are the same. And different cars have varying risks of suddenly immobilizing their drivers.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">

			YourMechanic calculated the median cost by brand based on data from the cars they've serviced. Mercedes-Benz was voted <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.yourmechanic.com/article/the-most-and-least-expensive-cars-to-maintain-by-maddy-martin">second most expensive to maintain</a> over ten years. If something goes wrong on the road, Mercedes extended warranty coverage may be able to save you money on unexpected repair costs.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">

			Whether you need a Mercedes AMG extended warranty or a Mercedes CLA warranty, we have coverage plans for all Mercedes Benz models!</p>

			

			<h2 class="mb-2 mt-3">Why do I need an extended car warranty?</h2>		

			<p class="mb-2">The overall extended warranty cost is one of the most important considerations. As a Mercedes Benz owner, you want your Mercedes Benz USA warranty less expensive than your vehicle's estimated repairs. Mercedes Benz offers excellent coverage but few options to select from when it comes to a Mercedes extended auto warranty. With our extended warranty packages, you can choose between three coverage levels at various pricing points. This allows you to only pay for the coverage you need.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">You'll also need to consider where you'll take your Mercedes Benz for warranty service. The Mercedes-Benz warranty is only valid at Mercedes Benz dealerships that are authorized. With your manufacturer's extended warranty, you are limited to only certain professional Mercedes Benz experts working on your car at a dealership.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">A standard warranty on Mercedes Benz will likely not provide adequate coverage. But, with our Mercedes Benz car warranty, car owners can enjoy maximum protection from all sorts of damage, regardless of the high costs. So, with a warranty for Mercedes Benz, you can get the most out of your vehicle.</p>



			<p class="mb-2">By selecting one of our warranty packages, an extended warranty is a better alternative if you do not live near a Mercedes Benz dealership or do not want to take your vehicle to a dealership. We accept any ASE Certified technician across the country, so our warranty on Mercedes isn't limited to your location.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">With a Mercedes extended car warranty, our agents can help you 24/7 when you have a breakdown. We are only one call away with unlimited claims to get you and your car to safety.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">A Mercedes Benz extended warranty protects your vehicle against costly repairs and routine maintenance costs. If you ever decide to trade in or sell your vehicle, it will be worth more if regularly maintained and serviced.</p>



			<h2 class="mb-2 mt-3">What does an extended warranty for Mercedes Benz cover?</h2>

			

			<p class="mb-2">We have three different extended warranty Mercedes Benz coverage levels to suit every type of pocket. The Select Silver, Select Gold, and Select Platinum are priced differently, offering extended warranty for Mercedes Benz owners all across the country.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">The Select Silver package is a little more expensive, but you'll get more extended car warranty Mercedes Benz coverage. It provides basic coverage for your Mercedes Benz's engine, transmission, brakes, and electrical system. Even though this is the entry-level package, you can rest easy knowing that your new or pre-owned Mercedes Benz is covered for major repairs. We've also included a rental car and 24-hour roadside assistance in case you need it during an emergency event.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">Suppose you're looking for a higher level of protection than the Silver package provides. In this instance, the Select Gold package will cover everything in the Select Silver package, plus steering system coverage and lock-out protection.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">You may need a comprehensive Mercedes Benz extended auto warranty because a Mercedes Benz is expensive to maintain. The Select Platinum package has all of the features of the Select Silver and Select Gold packages, plus nine additional systems. The Select Platinum covers your Mercedes Benz's turbo/supercharger, as well as the suspension, heating and fuel system, AC system, and ABS brakes.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">The German automaker made AWD 4x4 standard in nearly all of their models. This 4-Matic AWD feature makes your car ready for all weather conditions. Don't get stuck in harsh weather conditions – we have your 4x4 AWD covered under the Select Platinum package!</p>



			<p class="mb-2">Roadside assistance is included in all three warranty Mercedes Benz packages, so you'll have someone on speed dial if your car breaks down on the side of the road. Our Extended warranty plans aren't just for new Mercedes Benz owners; we also have a used car warranty for Mercedes pre-owned warranty cars!</p>

			

			<h2 class="mb-2 mt-3">Mercedes Benz new car warranty </h2>

			

			<p class="mb-2">A Mercedes Benz new car warranty is almost non-negotiable for your new car. Your Mercedes Benz comes with a New Vehicle Limited Warranty directly from the manufacturer when you buy a new car. But, the cover may not offer sufficient coverage for your new vehicle. </p>

			<p class="mb-2">When purchasing a new Mercedes Benz, you automatically get a New Vehicle Limited Warranty, which covers the vehicle for 48 months or 50,000 miles, whichever comes first. If the manufacturer's warranty coverage doesn't cover something, or if your warranty expires, you'll be responsible for costly repairs.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">We provide a Mercedes-Benz new car warranty that includes services, maintenance, and coverage for all types of costly repairs. Extending your vehicle's protection will save you money on costly repairs and give your vehicle an extended life.</p>

			

			<h2 class="mb-2 mt-3">Mercedes pre-owned warranty</h2>

			<p class="mb-2">Our Mercedes used car warranty packages are available to anyone who does not own a new car. When you buy a Mercedes used car warranty, your vehicle must be in good functional order to qualify for full coverage.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">If you buy a pre-owned Mercedes Benz from a third party, you run the risk of having to pay high prices for repairs. A Mercedes used car warranty protects your vehicle against major expenses that may occur in the future. With your extended warranty coverage, you can keep your Mercedes' value and sell it later.</p>

			

			<h2 class="mb-2 mt-3">Is a Mercedes Benz extended warranty worth it?</h2>

			

			<p class="mb-2">If you want the performance of a Mercedes Benz, you must be willing to pay the price. That is the cost of maintenance. When compared to other vehicle brands, Mercedes-Benz maintenance costs are quite high. As mentioned before, it placed in second place in a research conducted by YourMechanic. Mercedes drivers can expect to spend an average of $908 each year on maintenance and repairs costs. Extended car protection offsets repair expenses, shielding your budget from a costly surprise.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">Mercedes Benz vehicles may experience issues such as:</p>

			<ul class="ml-4">

			<li class="ml-4">Automatic transmission shifting is jerky</li>

			<li class="ml-4">Hydraulic fluid can leak from the active body control system</li>

			<li class="ml-4">Camshaft adjuster solenoid failure</li>

			<li class="ml-4">Ignition failure caused by worn-out spark plugs</li>

			</ul>



			<p class="mb-2">In the event that something goes wrong with your vehicle, and you didn't purchase a Mercedes Benz extended warranty, you're responsible for the repair costs. Regularly servicing your Mercedes can also cost you money over time.</p>
