			<p class="mb-2">If you are planning to get a Lexus sedan, coupe, or SUV, you’re probably aware of the Japanese automaker’s quality and reliability. <a href="https://www.kbb.com/car-news/consumer-reports-lexus-makes-the-most-reliable-cars-lincoln-the-least/" rel="nofollow">According to a recent report</a>, Lexus got a perfect reliability score and ranked #1 among other car manufacturers.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">However, even the most reliable car won’t be invincible. Your new set of wheels deserves the best care possible, so common repairs are usually covered under an auto warranty. But it’s still imperative to understand what’s included in a Lexus warranty in case of an unexpected problem.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">Further, we will describe what’s covered in a Lexus extended warranty.</p>



			<h2 class="mb-2 mt-3">Lexus Manufacturer Warranty Coverage</h2>

			<p class="mb-2">You're covered by a complete Lexus Manufacturer Warranty that’s supposed to give you miles and miles of confidence when you get a new car from a dealership.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">The Lexus Manufacturer Warranty consists of 5 parts:</p>

			

			<table class="table table-bordered">

				<tr>

					<th>Warranty type</th>

					<th>What is covered</th>

					<th>Length</th>

				</tr>

				<tr>

					<td>Basic</td>

					<td>If any vehicle part (except some exclusions) has a defect, the manufacturer will replace or repair it.</td>

					<td>50,000 miles or 48 months</td>

				</tr>

					<td>Hybrid</td>

					<td>Hybrid car components (battery, inverter, etc.)</td>

			<h2 class="mb-2 mt-3">What Is Not Covered by Lexus Manufacturer Warranty</h2>



			<p class="mb-2">Lexus warranty doesn’t cover the following situations:</p>

			

			<ul class="ml-4">

			<li class="ml-4">Negligence or abuse</li>

			<li class="ml-4">Normal wear and tear</li>

			<li class="ml-4">Improper maintenance, including use of non-specified fluids</li>

			<li class="ml-4">Fire, accidents, or theft</li>

			<li class="ml-4">Environmental damage</li>

			<li class="ml-4">Undeterminable vehicle identification number (VIN)</li>

			<li class="ml-4">Odometer tampering</li>

			<li class="ml-4">Faulty repairs</li>

			<li class="ml-4">Tires </li>

			<li class="ml-4">Normal maintenance services</li> 

			</ul>

			

			<p class="mb-2">Check your Lexus guarantee guide for extra info on what’s not covered. When shopping for a brand new Lexus, it’s essential to examine the warranty to understand what's and isn’t covered.</p>



			<h2 class="mb-2 mt-3">Lexus Extended Warranty Coverage</h2>

			

			<p class="mb-2">A standard Lexus factory warranty lasts just a few years until your car needs repairs.</p> 

			

			<p class="mb-2">When your Factory Warranty Coverage expires, it may make sense to lengthen coverage by purchasing a Lexus extended warranty, also known as a Vehicle Services Agreement (VSA). </p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">While Lexus is an impressively reliable car manufacturer, their cars still may need a repair. Regularly scheduled maintenance may help extend your car’s lifespan, but as your car ages, it starts to break down due to continued use over the years.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">The manufacturer offers three options that come with 24/7 roadside assistance, reimbursement for travel expenses, and access to the Lexus nationwide service network: <strong>Extra Care Powertrain</strong>, <strong>Extra Care Platinum</strong>, and <strong>Extra Care Gold</strong>.</p>

			

			<h2 class="mb-2 mt-3">Will You Be Able to Afford to Repair Your Lexus?</h2>

			<p class="mb-2"><a href="https://repairpal.com/reliability/lexus" rel="nofollow">According to RepairPal</a>, Lexus cars have a low annual repair cost of around $551.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">Some Lexus repairs can, however, be extremely pricey. For example, replacing your Lexus head gasket could cost upwards of $1,800 for parts and labor, and an alternator replacement could set you back $1,400 or more.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">If any of these problems developed after your Lexus factory warranty expiry, you’d be the one footing the repair bill.</p>

			

			<h2 class="mb-2 mt-3">Lexus Extended Warranty Costs</h2>

			

			<p class="mb-2">Lexus extended warranty cost depends on factors like the cost and condition of your car, where you live, and your coverage level (plan and option).</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">The average Lexus owner in the United States pays approximately $2,800 for their extended warranties. This figure is, in some cases, lower than the cost of one repair.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">Contact your local Lexus dealer to get a Lexus extended warranty quote.</p>

			

			<h2 class="mb-2 mt-3">Lexus New Car Warranty</h2>

			

			<p class="mb-2">Luxury cars are expensive to maintain because they often require special components and extensive servicing. You will never be hit with an unexpected repair bill from the blues because you already settled the full cost of all covered repairs in the new car warranty contract.</p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">If you intend to sell your car down the road, it is considered crucial to make note that Lexus cars under warranty coverage can be more attractive to potential consumers.</p>



			<h2 class="mb-2 mt-3">Lexus Used Car Warranty</h2>

			

			<p class="mb-2">If you buy a CPO Lexus, you will enjoy an extension of the original Lexus Factory Warranty of up to 6 years and unrestricted mileage of basic coverage from the first owner’s date of purchase. </p>

			

			<p class="mb-2">This warranty includes complimentary roadside maintenance and 20,000 miles or 2 years of regular maintenance, whichever comes first. Your vehicle should pass a 161-point inspection to qualify for CPO status. </p>



			<h2 class="mb-2 mt-3">Should You Purchase an Extended Warranty from Us?</h2>

			

			<p class="mb-2">While you experience top-notch service from licensed technicians with an extended warranty from Lexus, it does restrict your alternatives in terms of where you could repair your car. The manufacturer will probably require you to get all service carried out at a Lexus dealership.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">It is additionally worth mentioning that most Lexus warranties are rolled up into your financed payment. This means that you may possibly be paying interest on the total cost.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">We offer one main benefit over dealer-backed plans – flexibility. You will be able to bring your vehicle to your preferred neighborhood auto service for repairs.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">Besides that, you can make an order of your coverage online as opposed to visiting a dealer, have extra coverage stages to choose from, and could never pay interest on the price.</p> 

			

			<h2 class="mb-2 mt-3">Risk-Free Coverage with Select Auto Protect</h2>

			

			<p class="mb-2">If you are interested in independent, factory-level coverage, choose Select Auto Protect.</p> 

			<p class="mb-2">You will definitely enjoy perks like diverse payment plans, unlimited service calls, and a wider network of repair facilities.</p>
